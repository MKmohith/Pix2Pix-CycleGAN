# Pix2Pix-CycleGAN
This project implements a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) using PyTorch for unpaired image-to-image translation. The model consists of two generator networks and two discriminator networks, enabling learning of mappings between two image domains (e.g., trainA and trainB) without requiring paired training data.
